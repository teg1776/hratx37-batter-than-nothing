# Donut Shop

You'll be building a full stack application for a new company that creates and ships custom donuts.

The application MVP involves three primary features:

- Listing all donuts
- Creating a new custom donut with custom toppings
- Adding donuts to a shopping cart and placing an order

The main objective is to:

```terminal
Create a full stack CRUD application
that contains multiple, connected tables in a SQL database
and responds to AJAX requests from the React client
```

## Getting Started

This full stack application is separated in to two folders - client and server.

- Client directory instructions:

  - In terminal: `npm install`
  - Separate terminal window: `npm run script-build`
  - Separate terminal window: `npm start`

- Server directory instruction:
  - Install knex cli: `npm install -g knex`
  - Create a blank postgres database
  - Configure your 'knexfile.js'
  - In terminal, run each command: `npm install`, `knex migrate:latest`, `knex seed:run`
  - Separate terminal window: `npm start`

## Technologies

- Server
  - Node / Express
  - Postgres DB
  - Knex Query Builder
- Client
  - React

## Requirements

This solo sprint is a greenfield project but with technology decisions and specific user stories already made for you. Just like your future job!

You are encouraged to go beyond the initial MVP and add your own features and flair!

1. Create an ERD with a tool like [draw.io](https://draw.io) and include the image in your final repository

2. Complete all user stories (see [userstories.md](./userstories.md))

3. Let users add their own custom donut images

4. Create your own custom feature that incorporates an external API.

5. Refactor to use [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

6. Add user accounts

7. Take it to the next level. Your donut shop is starting to take off, users are demanding new an exciting features! Can you distrupt the donut the industry?

   - You could create a dashboard that shows the most popular donut toppings, most donuts sold, etc.
   - Add a voting feature to each donut
   - Add searching and filtering of donuts

## Resources

You may use online resources.
Here are some things you might want to reference:

- [Look for migrations CLI](https://knexjs.org/#Installation-migrations)
  - You will need to use the `knex migrate` commands to update the database
- [Look for express.Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
